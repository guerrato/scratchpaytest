  <h2>RESTful API Documentation</h2>

  <p>
    This document presents the result of the ScratchPay code challenge, showcasing the RESTful API developed using
    ExpressJS. The API is designed to meet the specified requirements and incorporates a range of features to ensure a
    robust and efficient solution.
  </p>

  <p>
    The ScratchPay RESTful API leverages the power of ExpressJS to provide a scalable and performant backend for clinic
    provider search. It follows the principles of REST architecture, utilizing HTTP methods and status codes for
    communication with resources. The API is stateless, ensuring that each request contains all the necessary
    information for processing.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can access the project and its source code on the GitHub repository: <a
      href="https://github.com/guerrato/scratchpaytest">https://github.com/guerrato/scratchpaytest</a>. The repository
    serves as a central hub for collaboration, enabling you to review the code, contribute, and provide feedback.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout this documentation, you will find comprehensive details about the API's RESTful properties, an example of
    an authentication endpoint, various search endpoint examples, information about the tests and code documentation,
    integration of API documentation with Swagger, Docker support for easy containerization, and integration with CI/CD
    using GitHub Actions.
  </p>

  <p>
    By exploring this documentation and reviewing the project on GitHub, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of
    the ScratchPay RESTful API and its capabilities.

  </ul>

  <p>Please note that the <code>x-auth-token</code> header with the value of
    <code>'5f8a3b76-4998-4e22-a3b7-84f22c9a12d3'</code> should be included in the request header for authentication.
  </p>

  <h3>Tests</h3>

  <p>
    The API is thoroughly tested to ensure its correctness and functionality. A comprehensive

    test suite is created using a testing framework (e.g., Jest). The tests cover various scenarios, including positive
    and negative cases, edge cases, and different input combinations. The test suite also includes tests for
    authentication and search endpoints.
  </p>

  <p>
    To run the tests and get test coverage statistics, execute the following command in the project directory:
  </p>

  <pre><code>npm test</code></pre>

  <p>
    The command will run the test suite and provide a summary of the test results, including the number of passed and
    failed tests. Additionally, it will generate coverage reports indicating the percentage of code coverage achieved by
    the tests. These coverage reports provide insights into which parts of the codebase are adequately covered by tests
    and highlight areas that may require additional testing.
  </p>

  <p>
    By running the tests and reviewing the coverage statistics, you can assess the effectiveness of the test suite in
    ensuring the correctness and stability of the API.
  </p>

  <h3>Code Documentation</h3>

  <p>
    The codebase includes documentation to improve readability and maintainability. The files are documented, providing
    explanations and descriptions of the purpose and functionality of each module, class, and function. The
    documentation aids in understanding the code by providing context and insights into the code's structure and
    implementation.
  </p>

  <p>
    By documenting the code, it becomes easier for developers to navigate and comprehend the codebase. They can quickly
    grasp the functionality of different components, their dependencies, and how they interact with each other. This
    promotes better collaboration, code reuse, and maintenance of the API.
  </p>

  <h3>API Documentation with Swagger</h3>

  <p>
    The API documentation is generated using Swagger, which provides an interactive interface to explore and interact
    with the API endpoints. The codebase includes Swagger annotations that describe the API's structure, endpoints,
    parameters, and responses.
  </p>

  <p>
    To access the Swagger documentation page, navigate to the <a href="/docs">/docs</a> route of the API. This will present a
    user-friendly interface where you can browse the available endpoints, view their descriptions, and test them by
    providing the required parameters. The Swagger documentation simplifies the process of understanding and working
    with the API, making it easier to integrate and utilize its features.
  </p>

  <p>
    By utilizing Swagger for API documentation, developers and users can gain insights into the available endpoints,
    their input requirements, and the expected output. This enhances the overall user experience and facilitates the
    integration of the API into various client applications.
  </p>

  <h3>Docker</h3>

  <p>
    The project includes Docker support for easy containerization and deployment. Docker enables consistent and isolated
    environments across different systems. With the provided Docker configuration, the API can be easily packaged into a
    Docker image, allowing for seamless deployment and scalability.
  </p>

  <h3>CI/CD</h3>

  <p>
    The project includes an implementation for Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions. The CI setup ensures
    that the codebase is automatically built, tested, and validated on each commit or pull request. This helps maintain
    code quality, catch issues early, and provide feedback to the development team. Continuous Deployment (CD) can also
    be integrated with the CI process to automatically deploy the API to a staging or production environment based on
    predefined rules and conditions.
  </p>
